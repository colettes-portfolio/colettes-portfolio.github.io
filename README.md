# About me
Sustainability manager and urban informatics specialist focusing on energy infrastructure, efficiency, conservation, and affordability. 

I am currently completing my MS in Urban Informatics at Northeastern University, where I developed a strong focus on exploring the concept of energy burden—the percentage of household income spent on energy costs—and its implications for urban resilience, particularly in Massachusetts and in the City of Boston.

I also currently serve as the Sustainability Manager of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, where I lead strategic sustainability planning, with a strong emphasis on green labs initiatives, energy and emissions data analysis, and the evaluation of procurement practices through a sustainability lens.
A significant part of my work involves conducting energy savings analyses, assessing the financial and resource impacts of projects or new equipment in laboratories, and analyzing the implications of carbon regulations and commitments on our institution. 

Through my academic and professional work, I focus on improving energy systems and building infrastructure, as well as analyzing the efficacy and impacts of carbon and energy regulations on building owners and residents. I'm passionate about leveraging data science and urban informatics to address challenges in energy affordability, community resiliency, and climate change adaptation in MA.

# Understanding Energy Burden

"This is New England. It gets cold. We're cold," says Sherona Kravits. A widow living on a fixed income, before her husband passed away, they shared the bills. Now, she has to make sacrifices. "And I work part time, and so...you know I'm thinking of getting another, going back to my other part time job which I had before covid, and so I'll have two part-time jobs. And I'll just...in order to survive."

These stories from residents of Massachusetts are not isolated incidents, but rather a reflection of the hardships faced by thousands across the state. The difficulties reached a peak for some communities during the winter of 2022 when energy rates surged to historic highs due to the war in Ukraine.

Energy is a crucial source of economic and industrial growth; it is a basic and necessary input for all modern production and consumption activities in the US economy. It enables all systems to meet modern human needs -- food, shelter, employment, and transportation. However, when accessing or affording energy is challenging, it can become a financial and hazardous liability for residential customers, often referred to as "energy burden". Energy burden is a complex and compound issue used to describe the inability to afford utility costs, leading households to forgo spending in other categories, often other necessities like food, what is sometimes referred to as the "heat or eat" choice.

The tradeoffs that households face when confronting energy burden are not short term - not only do they mean forgoing spending on necessities like food, health care, shelter in the short term, they also contribute to a negative feedback loop that can trap families in an enduring cycle of poverty. When low-income families are unable to pay utility bills, and face utility shut offs and evictions, these are legal processes, associated with social security records and appearing on background checks, which can have lifelong administrative impacts on housing and employment access. They can also have impacts on access to future credit.

## My Research

Through my work, I examine different dimensions of energy burden in Massachusetts. Below are three projects that explore this critical issue:

### [Project 1: Estimating Energy Burden Risk in Boston](project1.md)

Developed an Energy Burden Risk Score (EBRS) based on property assessment/characteristic data to identify areas potentially facing energy burden.

### [Project 2: Energy Burden in Boston: A Geospatial Analysis](project2.md)

A geospatial examination identifying areas with the highest opportunity for additional or increased energy efficiency programs to alleviate estimated energy burdens. Found strong correlations between energy burden and socio-economic indicators, highlighting the need for targeted outreach and assistance in specific neighborhoods.

### [Project 3: Beyond the Burden: Pathways to Urban Resilience](project3.md)

An analysis of how energy burdens in Massachusetts evolved from 2017-2022, revealing large increases in both magnitude and quantity of areas experiencing higher energy burdens, particularly concentrated among low-income and minority communities. The findings emphasize the need for increased investment in energy-efficient housing solutions in low-income areas and the importance of equitable access to clean energy upgrades.
