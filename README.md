# About me
Sustainability manager and urban informatics specialist focusing on energy infrastructure, efficiency, conservation, and affordability. 

I am currently completing my MS in Urban Informatics at Northeastern University, where I developed a strong focus on exploring the concept of energy burden—the percentage of household income spent on energy costs—and its implications for urban resilience, particularly in Massachusetts and in the City of Boston.

I also currently serve as the Sustainability Manager of Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, where I lead strategic sustainability planning, with a strong emphasis on green labs initiatives, energy and emissions data analysis, and the evaluation of procurement practices through a sustainability lens.
A significant part of my work involves conducting energy savings analyses, assessing the financial and resource impacts of projects or new equipment in laboratories, and analyzing the implications of carbon regulations and commitments on our institution. 

Through my academic and professional work, I focus on improving energy systems and building infrastructure, as well as analyzing the efficacy and impacts of carbon and energy regulations on building owners and residents. I'm passionate about leveraging data science and urban informatics to address challenges in energy affordability, community resiliency, and climate change adaptation in MA.

# Understanding Energy Burden in Massachusetts
Energy burden is a critical challenge facing many households, particularly in regions like New England with its cold winters and rising energy costs. When accessing or affording energy becomes challenging, it can become a financial and hazardous liability for residential customers.

# What is Energy Burden?
Energy burden is calculated as the proportion of a household's annual utility bills out of their annual household income. However, it represents more than just a calculation - it's a complex issue that describes the inability to afford utility costs, often forcing households to make impossible choices between heating their homes and other necessities like food, what is commonly referred to as the "heat or eat" choice.

# The Cycle of Energy Burden
The tradeoffs households face when confronting energy burden are not short term. Beyond forgoing immediate necessities, energy burden contributes to a negative feedback loop that can trap families in an enduring cycle of poverty:

 * When families cannot pay utility bills, they face shutoffs and potential eviction
 * These create legal records affecting future housing and employment access
 * Fear of eviction can lead to taking on predatory payday loans
 * Households may skip medical care or medications
 * These compounding factors make it increasingly difficult to escape poverty without intervention

# Why It Matters Now
This issue is particularly pertinent today as:

 * Oil and gas market volatility has contributed to some of the highest inflation rates in forty years
* In recent years, utilities serving Massachusetts customers have hiked winter energy prices significantly:
    + National Grid: 64% increase in electricity bills
    + Eversource: 23% increase in electricity bills
    + Similar increases in gas pricing
 * Climate change is creating more extreme temperatures, increasing both heating and cooling needs

# The Compound Nature of Energy Burden
Low-income residents are more likely to live in poor quality housing, creating a compounding effect:

 * Inefficient properties increase energy costs disproportionately
 * Higher income households have more flexibility to absorb unexpected high bills
 * Lower income households often lack means to invest in efficiency upgrades
 * Poor housing conditions often lead to higher energy consumption and costs

# Exploring Distribution, Estimation, Intensity, and Solutions Through Research
The following three projects examine different aspects of energy burden in Massachusetts:


## Estimating Energy Burden Risk in Boston via Property Characteristics
*December 2022*
[View Full Project Details](project1.md)


### Question
How can areas in Boston potentially facing energy burden be predicted based on the characteristics of their housing?

### Methods
- Developed an Energy Burden Risk Score (EBRS) based on property assessment/characteristic data
- Statistical analysis including correlation and regression modeling

### Key Findings
- Strong correlation between EBRS and actual energy consumption data
- Identified specific neighborhoods (e.g., Roslindale, Mattapan) with highest average EBRS 
- Specific building characteristics leading to larger energy burdens more frequently owned/rented in low-income areas


### Implications
- Need for targeted energy efficiency programs in specific neighborhoods
- Importance of addressing housing quality and housing characteristics in energy burden mitigation strategies 


## Energy Burden in Boston: A Geospatial Analysis of Residential Energy Consumption and Affordability
*April 2023*
[View Full Project Details](project2.md)
### Question
How can areas in Boston/MA with the highest opportunity for additional or increased energy efficiency programs be identified? (in order to alleviate estimated energy burdens)

### Methods
- Geospatial analysis using ArcGIS
- Data processing and manipulation of multiple datasets
- Statistical analysis including correlation and regression modeling

### Key Findings
- Identified block groups with both high estimated energy burden and low average savings from utility energy efficiency programs
- Found strong correlations between energy burden and socio-economic indicators 
- Identified areas with largest uptake of new energy technologies, like heat pumps

### Policy Implications
- Need for targeted outreach and assistance in specific neighborhoods
- Importance of addressing the energy efficiency gap between income groups


## Beyond the Burden: Pathways to Urban Resilience in the Energy Crisis of Massachusetts
*April 2024*
[View Full Project Details](project3.md)
### Questions
- How have energy burdens in Massachusetts evolved from 2017-2022?
- What are the correlations between energy burdens and socioeconomic and demographic indicators?
- How can large price shocks on specific utilities impact different types of customers?

### Methods
- Quantitative analysis of energy consumption and cost data
- Qualitative analysis including interviews with energy assistance professionals
- Multiple regression modeling

### Key Findings
- Large increase in the magnitude and quantity of areas experiencing higher energy burdens between 2017-2022
- Increases were particularly concentrated among low-income and minority communities 



### Policy Implications
- Need for increased investment in energy-efficient housing solutions in low-income areas
- Importance of equitable access to clean energy upgrades
