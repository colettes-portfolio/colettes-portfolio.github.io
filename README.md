# About me
Sustainability manager and urban informatics specialist focusing on energy infrastructure, efficiency, conservation, and affordability. I currently serve as the Sustainability Manager at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, where I lead initiatives a wide range of sustainability efforts across our campus. My role encompasses strategic sustainability planning, with a strong emphasis on green labs initiatives, energy and emissions data analysis, and the evaluation of procurement practices through a sustainability lens.
A significant part of my work involves conducting in-depth energy savings analyses, assessing the financial and resource impacts of projects or new equipment in laboratories, and analyzing the implications of carbon regulations and commitments on our institution. I leverage data-driven approaches to enhance environmental sustainability in medical education and healthcare facilities.


I am currently completing my MS in Urban Informatics at Northeastern University, where I developed expertise and a strong focus in analyzing urban energy systems and their intersection with community resiliency and climate change. This academic background complements my professional work, which centers on exploring energy burden—the percentage of household income spent on energy costs—and its implications for urban resilience, particularly in Massachusetts and in the City of Boston.

Through my projects and professional role, I focus on improving energy systems and building infrastructure, as well as the new policies that attempt to regulate existing and new construction buildings, their owners, and their emissions. I'm passionate about leveraging data science and urban informatics to address critical challenges in energy affordability, sustainable building practices, and climate change adaptation. My approach combines quantitative analysis with an understanding of urban systems and green building strategies, aiming to contribute to more equitable, sustainable, and resilient cities and institutions.

Here you'll find a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills in geospatial analysis, statistical modeling, and research on energy burdens, while also highlighting the interconnections between energy systems, housing, and urban resilience. 


## Estimating Energy Burden Risk in Boston via Property Characteristics
*December 2022*

### Question
How can areas in Boston potentially facing energy burden be predicted based on the characteristics of their housing?

### Methods
- Developed an Energy Burden Risk Score (EBRS) based on property assessment/characteristic data
- Statistical analysis including correlation and regression modeling

### Key Findings
-Strong correlation between EBRS and actual energy consumption data
-Identified specific neighborhoods (e.g., Roslindale, Mattapan) with highest average EBRS 
-Specific building characteristics leading to larger energy burdens more frequently owned/rented in low-income areas


### Implications
-Need for targeted energy efficiency programs in specific neighborhoods
-Importance of addressing housing quality and housing characteristics in energy burden mitigation strategies

## Energy Burden in Boston: A Geospatial Analysis of Residential Energy Consumption and Affordability
*April 2023*

### Question
How can areas in Boston/MA with the highest opportunity for additional or increased energy efficiency programs be identified? (in order to alleviate estimated energy burdens)

### Methods
- Geospatial analysis using ArcGIS
- Data processing and manipulation of multiple datasets
- Statistical analysis including correlation and regression modeling

### Key Findings
-Identified block groups with both high estimated energy burden and low average savings from utility energy efficiency programs
-Found strong correlations between energy burden and socio-economic indicators 
-Identified areas with largest uptake of new energy technologies, like heat pumps

### Policy Implications
- Need for targeted outreach and assistance in specific neighborhoods
- Importance of addressing the energy efficiency gap between income groups

## Beyond the Burden: Pathways to Urban Resilience in the Energy Crisis of Massachusetts
*April 2024*

### Questions
- How have energy burdens in Massachusetts evolved from 2017-2022?
- What are the correlations between energy burdens and socioeconomic and demographic indicators?
- How can large price shocks on specific utilities impact different types of customers?

### Methods
- Quantitative analysis of energy consumption and cost data
- Qualitative analysis including interviews with energy assistance professionals
- Multiple regression modeling

### Key Findings
-Large increase in the magnitude and quantity of areas experiencing higher energy burdens between 2017-2022
-Increases were particularly concentrated among low-income and minority communities 

### Policy Implications
- Need for increased investment in energy-efficient housing solutions in low-income areas
- Importance of equitable access to clean energy upgrades
