# About me
Sustainability manager and urban informatics specialist focusing on energy infrastructure, efficiency, conservation, and affordability. I currently serve as the Sustainability Manager at Harvard Medical School and the Harvard School of Dental Medicine, where I lead initiatives a wide range of sustainability efforts across our campus. My role encompasses strategic sustainability planning, with a strong emphasis on green labs initiatives, energy and emissions data analysis, and the evaluation of procurement practices through a sustainability lens.
A significant part of my work involves conducting in-depth energy savings analyses, assessing the financial and resource impacts of projects or new equipment in laboratories, and analyzing the implications of carbon regulations and commitments on our institution. I leverage data-driven approaches to enhance environmental sustainability in medical education and healthcare facilities.


I am currently completing my MS in Urban Informatics at Northeastern University, where I developed expertise and a strong focus in analyzing urban energy systems and their intersection with community resiliency and climate change. This academic background complements my professional work, which centers on exploring energy burden—the percentage of household income spent on energy costs—and its implications for urban resilience, particularly in Massachusetts and in the City of Boston.

Through my projects and professional role, I focus on improving energy systems and building infrastructure, as well as the new policies that attempt to regulate existing and new construction buildings, their owners, and their emissions. I'm passionate about leveraging data science and urban informatics to address critical challenges in energy affordability, sustainable building practices, and climate change adaptation. My approach combines quantitative analysis with an understanding of urban systems and green building strategies, aiming to contribute to more equitable, sustainable, and resilient cities and institutions.

Here you'll find a selection of projects that demonstrate my skills in geospatial analysis, statistical modeling, and research on energy burdens, while also highlighting the interconnections between energy systems, housing, and urban resilience. 
#MS Portfolio
### Estimating Energy Burden Risk in Boston via Property Characteristics
*December 2022*

Used 2021 City of Boston's Property Assessment dataset to predict areas experiencing elevated energy burden.

Key Findings:
- Strong correlation between Energy Burden Risk Score (EBRS) and actual energy consumption
- Identified neighborhoods with highest average EBRS (e.g., Roslindale, Mattapan)
- Low-income areas more likely to have building characteristics leading to larger energy burdens

*Map of EBRS distribution across Boston (scores above 0.5)*

### Energy Burden in Boston: A Geospatial Analysis of Residential Energy Consumption and Affordability
*April 2023*

Geospatial analysis to identify areas needing increased energy efficiency programs.

Key Findings:
- Identified block groups with high energy burden and low utility program savings
- Strong correlations between energy burden and socio-economic indicators
- Mapped areas with highest uptake of new energy technologies (e.g., heat pumps)

### Beyond the Burden: Pathways to Urban Resilience in the Energy Crisis of Massachusetts
*April 2024*


Examined evolution of energy burdens in Massachusetts from 2017-2022.

Key Findings:
- Significant increase in magnitude and spread of high energy burdens (2017-2022)
- Low-income and minority communities most affected
- Strong correlations between energy burden and various socioeconomic factors
