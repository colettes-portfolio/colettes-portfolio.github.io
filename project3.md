# Beyond the Burden: Pathways to Urban Resilience in the Energy Crisis of Massachusetts

## Introduction
<p>What can you sacrifice at this point? “Food.,” says Sherona Kravits, in an interview with WCVB Channel 5 Boston in February of 2022 (WCVB Channel 5 Boston 2022). Kravits has been paying for oil to heat her home for over 35 years. “This is New England. It gets cold. We’re cold.”  Sherona is a widow, living on a fixed income. Before her husband passed away, they shared the bills. Now, she has to make sacrifices. “And I work part time, and so...you know I’m thinking of getting another, going back to my other part time job which I had before covid, and so I’ll have two part-time jobs. And I’ll just…in order to survive.”  In the basement of her home where she’s lived for 38 years, Elaine Walker offers up a similar struggle. Looking at her oil tank at ¾ full, she says: “That probably won’t last me until the end of December, it won’t. I’m very nervous” (WCVB Channel 5 Boston 2022) Last year, Walker received about a thousand dollars in assistance through a local nonprofit called ABCD but had to pay $400 out of pocket. Since then, home heating oil costs in MA went from $3.30 a gallon in 2021, to $5.70 a gallon in 2022. She adds, “If I don’t get the oil, I cannot afford to pay out of my retirement, salary, what I get. So, if I doesn’t get help from ABCD, I am going to freeze!”. Without more help, Walker says she’ll keep the thermostat low and spend the winter huddled under blankets. And she says some of her neighbors will have it even worse: “I know people that have to go to other people’s house because they don’t have any heat, or the oil run out. You can’t stay in the house” (WCVB Channel 5 Boston 2022). And in another segment, from CBS Boston on March 3, 2022, 91-year-old Joseph Brooks of Hyde Park, MA says that filling his oil tank at the current price, would be impossible, saying: “once you buy oil, you don’t have any money to buy anything else. All I have is social security” (CBS Boston 2022).  The day before getting the delivery, the average was $4 gallon, and the day of Joseph’s delivery - $5.02.</p>

<p> These stories from residents of Massachusetts are not isolated incidents, but rather a reflection of the hardships faced by thousands across the state. The difficulties reached a peak for some communities during the winter of 2022 when energy rates surged to historic highs due to the war in Ukraine. Today, many continue to struggle amid ongoing rate hikes across all utilities and rising overall costs of living, all without corresponding increases in income. This piece argues that rising energy burdens in Massachusetts, exacerbated by socioeconomic disparities and market volatility, significantly undermines urban resilience by increasing vulnerability amongst these households. While short-term strategies like heat assistance are necessary for maintaining survival for many households in the Commonwealth, this paper argues that they are palliative and are not adequate, and not addressing the underlying causes and changes in conditions that have generated these conditions for households. It most often impacts low-income households, who during times of market fluctuations or intense weather, results in the proportion of their income dedicated to heating/cooling their homes growing larger, beyond their capacity to afford other costs. For this reason, while stemming directly from energy expenses, energy burden is effectively generated by a combination of factors like income, housing quality and inefficiency, historic discriminatory planning policies, socioeconomic factors, and weather conditions. Enhancing energy efficiency and ensuring equitable access to affordable energy are identified in this piece as the critical long-term strategies for reducing vulnerability. They are essential for fostering resilient urban communities in the face of continuing economic stress and climate change impacts. This study quantifies energy burdens across Massachusetts from 2017-2022, assesses their correlation with socioeconomic and demographic indicators, and proposes interventions to reduce these burdens and strengthen urban resilience. The findings argue that enhancing energy efficiency and equitable access to energy resources are critical to mitigating this burden and fostering resilient urban communities in the face of economic and environmental challenges, and that existing efforts to reduce vulnerability like heat assistance and existing energy efficiency programs may not be enough.</p>



# Methodology

## Quantitative Analysis

This study estimated energy burdens across Massachusetts using a combination of data sources and techniques:

1. **Data Sources**:
   - MassSave Customer Profile Dashboard for electricity and natural gas consumption
   - Massachusetts annual reports for alternative fuel consumption estimates
   - American Community Survey (ACS) for household heating fuel types and median income

2. **Energy Cost Estimation**:
   - Calculated costs for various energy types (electricity, natural gas, oil, wood, bottled gas)
   - Used ACS data to determine proportions of households using each fuel type
   - Created a weighted average energy cost per block group

3. **Data Cleaning and Imputation**:
   - Addressed missing data and outliers using median values from similar areas
   - Imputed natural gas data for areas with municipal providers

4. **Energy Burden Calculation**:
   - Estimated energy burden = (Estimated energy expenditure) / (Median household income)
   - Aggregated data to Census Tract level for broader coverage and easier analysis

## Qualitative Analysis

To complement the quantitative findings, I conducted interviews with professionals in the energy assistance/burden field:

- Interviewed directors of Community Action Organizations
- Used standardized questions to gather insights on:
  - Quantity of households facing energy burdens
  - Root causes of energy needs
  - Demographics of affected households
  - Effectiveness of energy efficiency support programs

This mixed-methods approach provided a comprehensive view of energy burdens in Massachusetts, combining data-driven analysis with on-the-ground expertise.

# Results

The results of the statistical analysis show that average energy costs and energy burden for many MA residents increased overall from 2017-2022, with residents shifting from one energy burden group to another.

The counts at each level of energy burden group vary from year to year. For example, from 2017-2018, there is a decrease in the up to 2% energy burden group and a corresponding increase in the 2-5% and 5-8% burden groups. The up to 2% burden group has the highest number of census tracts across all years, indicating that most MA residents have lower energy burdens. Also true is that the above 15% burden group has the lowest count, suggesting that fewer census tracts have experienced very high energy burdens across this time period. However, there are sizeable shifts across the years. In 2020, the Up to 2% and 2-5% burden groups experienced notable increases, while the 5-8% burden group saw a significant decrease. In 2021 and 2022, the 8-15% and 5-8% burden groups grew significantly, resulting in a decrease in the 2-5% and up to 2% groups.  The Above 15% burden group has remained stable, making up the smallest proportion across all years.

The results of average energy burdens by year and income group of census tracts reveal which income groups experienced the largest changes in burdens, and when:

The lowest income groups experienced both the largest burdens across all years, but also the largest changes in their estimated energy burdens, particularly in 2022. 

# Analysis & Regression

I tested my estimate for burden against several existing vulnerability and resiliency scores, like the SVI score (from the CDC), the EJScreen index (EPA), the Community resiliency Score (FEMA). I found that my estimates for burden had a strong inverse relationship with most community resiliency scores, suggesting that communities with higher energy burdens are indeed less equipped to prepare for, adapt to, and recover from hazards. 

I then brought in over 70 variables gathered from the American Community Survey in order to build a model. 

After examining correlations between variables, including using caution for multicollinearity, which can be difficult to avoid in such analyses, a backward stepwise regression approach was used, starting with a saturated model of all variables, gradually eliminates variables from the model that do not explain the outcome and that may be too highly correlated with one another.  
The final model: 
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df003451-c11f-470b-b889-584a83440f7b" alt="by year and income grp" title="yr group" align="center" hspace="60" vspace="60" width="60%" height="60%">
The final model shows that 56% of the variability in energy burden is explained by family poverty percentage, the percentage of households with bachelor’s degrees as their highest level of education, the percentage of housing units that are substandard, unemployment rate, ethnic heterogeneity, and eviction filing rate. The model indicates that factors associated with economic hardship (like family poverty percentage and unemployment rate) are positively correlated with the dependent variable, while indicators of socioeconomic advantage (such as higher educational attainment) show a negative correlation. Ethnic heterogeneity negatively correlates with the dependent variable, suggesting that areas with a higher mix of ethnic backgrounds might have, on average, lower energy burdens or less socioeconomic hardship. Eviction filing rates have a smaller but significant positive relationship which underscores that families experiencing hardships and increased energy burdens may be at increased risk for losing their housing and being evicted. The statistical significance of all predictors is strong (p < 0.01). 

## Interview Insights

I conducted an in-depth interview with the Energy Director of a community action agency in a major Massachusetts city. Key insights include:

- Evolution of Energy Assistance Programs: Community action agencies are focusing more on energy efficiency work to address the growing gap between income-scarce and income-secure populations.
- Federal Funding Challenges: Timing of federal funding, such as LIHEAP, often lags behind seasonal needs, impacting program effectiveness.
- Shift to Energy Efficiency: There's a trend towards energy efficiency measures and conversions to Air Source Heat Pumps (ASHP), primarily funded by utilities.
- Affordability vs. Environmental Goals: While ASHP conversions reduce carbon emissions, some customers face higher costs due to elevated electric rates.
- Equity and Advocacy: There's a strong focus on ensuring equitable access to energy assistance, including support for immigrants and non-English speakers.
- Landlord-Tenant Dynamics: Challenges arise in improving heating systems when landlords are unreachable or relationships are strained.
- Future Outlook: There's a need for increased funding and potential policy changes, such as including cooling assistance and extending LIHEAP calendars.
- Vulnerable Populations: Predatory electric competitive suppliers pose challenges for vulnerable communities.
- Impact of Moratoriums: COVID-19 shut-off moratoriums provided temporary relief but led to a surge in applications once lifted.

# Summmary

The quantitative and qualitative analysis can be summarized into three key findings. Between 2017-2022, there was:
1.	A large increase in the magnitude of energy burdens being experienced by households.
2.	A large increase in the quantity of areas experiencing higher energy burdens.
3.	These increases were particularly concentrated among low-income and minority communities, vulnerable residents, and those already experiencing economic hardship like unemployment and existing poverty.

# Implications
The key finding of this analysis is that the energy burdens faced by Massachusetts’ communities have grown disproportionately heavy for low-income and minority communities, intensifying socioeconomic disparities. Heightened energy burdens from price shocks such as those experienced in 2022 undermines their resilience, limiting the ability of these communities to withstand and recover from economic stress. As the Commonwealth strides toward its decarbonization goals, impact on energy pricing may deepen these fissures between income groups. Current energy policies and lack of regulation of utilities and of the competitive supply market may continue to widen the gap between income groups, which demands regulatory attention. The current pace of clean energy technology conversions is wanting due to: the lack of funding, the high rates for electricity service from utilities disincentivizing ASHP adoption, the cost of conversions (even with rebates) being too high for lower income households, and the lack of community knowledge and information sharing on clean energy. Continuing now with business as usual will widen the energy efficiency gap and leave already cost-burdened families extremely vulnerable as their energy costs rise. At some point, enough electrification will have taken place, and enough clean energy will be procured by the State that the cost of electricity will decrease significantly, and the cost of using older heating technologies may increase exponentially. This will result in households who have maintained old heating technology at a significant disadvantage, to face even higher energy burdens than they already do. Higher income families, or those who have successfully converted to electric technologies will weather the energy pricing storm without risk. The following policy recommendations attempt to shrink burdens in a long-term capacity, reduce vulnerability to pricing shocks, and to reduce the energy efficiency gap between income groups: 
•	Regulate Energy Pricing: If unable to end the competitive supply market for electricity in the state, the Commonwealth must implement stricter oversight to prevent predatory pricing and business tactics ensure fairness in energy costs for all. 
•	Expand Subsidies: Increase funding for home energy efficiency improvements targeted at low-income households as a long-term solution for reducing energy price shocks.
•	Expand short-term assistance: Increase LIHEAP funding to levels where cooling season demands of residents can be met.
•	Inclusive Community Outreach: Enhance outreach programs to ensure vulnerable populations are aware of resources and can avail necessary assistance without fear of deportation. 
•	Equitable Infrastructure Upgrades: Advocate for policies that consider the financial capabilities of all residents.
•	Equitable Energy Transition: Advocate for clean energy upgrades which are available and affordable to all and that upgrades to high income residents do not inadvertently increase energy costs for low-income residents. 
An increased energy burden does not just strain the economy by preventing households from spending money in other categories of goods; it is a substantial public health and social equity concern that undermines urban resilience by escalating community vulnerability to economic shocks. Community action programs are a crucial survival mechanism for families in Massachusetts, but their power and reach are insufficient to fully mitigate all of these challenges alone, which are increasing alongside the cost of living, higher energy costs, and increasing demand for energy as a whole. Improving energy efficiency and affordability directly contributes to community resilience, economic stability, and quality of life.
