# Executive Summary 
Regular seasonal utility costs can pose a crushing burden to many Americans and New Englanders, especially during its cold winters. During times of gas and oil market hikes, and particularly for households in extreme poverty, home energy costs represent an energy burden, which threaten their access to home heating, cooling, and electrification, but also ability to maintain housing, afford food, medical care, transportation, and all other necessities that provide basic survival standard of living. Because of energy burden’s close relationship to the quality of housing and energy inefficiency accessible to low-income households, this paper uses the 2021 City of Boston’s Property Assessment dataset, and the detailed property characteristics therein, to predict areas in the City that may be experiencing elevated energy burden. It examines calculations of energy burden risk through the lens of socio-economic demographic data from the 2015-2019 American Community Survey, as well as comparing the calculated risks to utility consumption from Mass Save’s 2020 Massachusetts Residential Customer Profile Study. This paper finds that access to energy efficient housing is not equitably distributed across the City of Boston, and this gap may grow. As regulatory agencies attempt to transition Boston to a low-carbon, sustainable energy future, while the options of technological upgrades and rebates will likely also expand, many of the existing programs and housing options that promote energy efficiency strategies to residential customers are remain inaccessible or infeasible to low-income or tenant households. The City of Boston and State of Massachusetts must take action to close the efficiency and housing quality gaps between low-income households and high-income households, especially in the context of moving forward with carbon free planning.
# The Energy Burden Issue 

Energy is a crucial source of economic and industrial growth; it is a basic and necessary input for all modern production and consumption activities in the US economy. It enables all systems to meet modern human needs – food, shelter, employment, and transportation. However, when accessing or affording energy is challenging, it can become a financial and hazardous liability for residential customers, often referred to as “energy burden”.  Energy burden is a complex and compound issue used to describe the inability to afford utility costs, leading households to forgo spending in other categories, often other necessities like food, what is sometimes referred to as the “heat or eat” choice. It most often impacts low-income households, who during times of market fluctuations or intense weather, results in the proportion of their income dedicated to heating/cooling their homes growing larger, beyond their capacity to afford other costs. For this reason, while stemming directly from energy expenses, energy burden is effectively generated by a combination of factors like income, housing quality and inefficiency, socioeconomic factors, and weather conditions. 
The tradeoffs that households face when confronting energy burden are not short term - not only do they mean forgoing spending on necessities like food, health care, shelter in the short term, they also contribute to a negative feedback loop that can trap families in an enduring cycle of poverty (Brown et al 2020). When low-income families are unable to pay utility bills, and face utility shut offs and evictions, these are legal processes, associated with social security records and appearing on background checks, which can have lifelong administrative impacts on housing and employment access. They can also have impacts on access to future credit. For this reason, households fearing eviction or records of non-payment are also more likely to take on predatory payday loans, which have extremely high interest rates, near impossible to pay back. The nature of the cycle of poverty is that it is difficult to escape without outside intervention, but that it is also compounding – and the case of energy burden is an effective example, a household unable to afford utility costs could mean not buying medications or avoiding doctor’s visits, leading to further medical concerns and the inability to work, and so the cycle continues (Brown et al 2020). 
This issue is particularly pertinent now, at the time of this article’s writing, as oil and gas market volatility and price hikes have assisted in igniting some of the highest inflation rates in over forty years in the United States. Citing global pressures and the war in Ukraine, National Grid and Eversource, the utilities serving most customers in Boston, have hiked their winter energy prices, resulting in an average monthly electricity bill increase by 64% (National Grid) and 23% (Eversource), and gas by 64% and 24% (Fortin, 2022). 
Energy burden is typically calculated as the proportion of a household’s annual utility bills out of their annual household income. However, effectively assessing energy burden at scale can be difficult due to the inaccessibility of sensitive utility and income data, and other methods would necessitate extensive surveying, which can be both resource intensive and subject to inherent bias. Referencing participation rates in heating assistance programs, like the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), is valuable, but these programs cannot capture families who are not eligible but are still experiencing energy burden, do not know the programs exist and did not apply, or who applied but were not awarded funds if funds were exhausted for the year.
As a response to the difficulties in assessing the extent and distribution of energy burdens, this study leverages the conceptual complexity of energy burden and its inextricable relationship with building energy efficiency, as well as the accuracy and completeness of Boston’s 2021 Property Assessment dataset, to identify the areas most at risk in the City of Boston for increased energy burden. The key logic behind associating property characteristics with energy burden is: that poor quality housing can exacerbate the inefficiency of properties and increase energy costs disproportionately beyond higher income owners who have the income to rent high quality or newer homes, with better insulation, more efficient appliances, and less energy leakage. Higher income households also have more income flexibility, so a few months’ worth of unexpectedly high energy bills will still make up a lower proportion of their total income, and these bills are less likely to prevent them from spending in other categories, especially necessities like food or rent. Furthermore, high income owners are more likely and more able to invest in efficiency upgrades, but low-income households often do not have the means to do so, even if these upgrades could result in long term energy bill savings. 

This study explores these key questions:
•	Can areas in Boston facing energy burden be predicted based on the characteristics of their housing?
•	Are these predictions associated with actual increased energy consumption? 
•	Where in Boston are they most concentrated?
