# Introduction
Energy burden, the inability to afford utility costs, disproportionately affects low-income households. This study examines the spatial distribution of energy burden in Boston, considering factors such as housing quality, energy efficiency, and socioeconomic indicators.
# Data & Methods
The study utilized three main datasets:

1. City of Boston Property Assessment dataset
2. Mass Save CY2021 Residential Customer Study
3. American Community Survey (2015-2019)

These datasets were combined with geospatial data of Boston's neighborhoods to analyze energy consumption, costs, and burden at the block group level.
# Primary Visualizations 
Average Household electricity use per block group: This map shows the average household electricity use for each block group in Boston. The data suggests that the highest electricity consumption occurs in the downtown area and parts of the South End. Other areas with higher-than-average electricity usage include East Boston, parts of Dorchester, and parts of Roxbury. In contrast, areas such as West Roxbury and Hyde Park tend to have lower than average electricity consumption.

the average household gas use for each block group in Boston. The data reveals that neighborhoods such as Dorchester , Mattapan, Jamaica Plain, and parts of Brighton tend to have the highest gas consumption, while areas like Mission Hill, South Boston, the South End, and Charlestown tend to have lower than average gas consumption. Many properties in Boston, especially triple deckers and brownstones, still have single building-wide heating systems like boilers with radiators, which are more difficult to submeter. Although landlords could invest in upgrades to submeter each apartment, they may find it cost prohibitive or inefficient to do so. As a result, landlords pay the utility bill and try to recoup these costs through rent increases, often telling tenants that heat is included in their base rent costs. This creates a market failure where both tenants and landlords have little incentive to conserve energy. For tenants living in inefficient buildings with heat-included rents, even if they are not paying monthly utility bills, they could still be facing increased costs due to energy costs being absorbed in the rent. While this cost increase may have benefits for some tenants, such as protection from market fluctuations and reduced monthly financial strain, it also creates an energy burden. Some building owners may try to increase rents to amounts greater than the overall utility costs, especially during years with higher gas prices, which places an even greater financial burden on tenants.
Policies that encourage the inclusion of energy costs in base rents could be appropriate if they lead to greater efficiency via investments in energy-efficient construction. However, if investing in individual metering of apartments is their response to challenges associated with higher utility costs, not investing in energy efficiency infrastructure, it will also not lead to greater energy efficiency at these properties. If building owners have no incentive to reduce the energy intensity of their properties since they can recoup costs via rent increases, properties’ energy burden ratio can still have a negative impact on tenants as they may be unable to afford the rent in these buildings.

: This map displays the estimated average annual energy costs per household for each block group in Boston. The data suggests that the highest energy costs tend to occur in the North End, parts of Roxbury, parts of Dorchester, Brighton, and Mattapan. In contrast, areas such as East Boston, South Boston, East Dorchester, and Roslindale tend to have lower than average energy costs.

This map displays the average household gas savings resulting from utility energy efficiency programs for each block group in Boston. The data shows that the highest savings tend to occur in neighborhoods such as Roxbury, Allston/Brighton, and West Roxbury. In contrast, areas such as South Boston, parts of Dorchester, and East Boston tend to have lower than average gas savings. Though the highest savings are appearing in the same areas as some of the highest average usage numbers, notably, the quantities of savings are quite low.

This map displays the average household electricity savings resulting from utility energy efficiency programs for each block group in Boston. The data shows that the highest savings tend to occur in Jamaica Plain, and parts of Dorchester and Mattapan. In contrast, areas such as the North End, the South End, and Easton Boston tend to have lower than average electricity savings. Similar to the gas savings estimates, though many of the areas with higher-than-average electricity consumption seem to have the highest savings estimates, which is a good sign that neighborhoods are well targeted, the savings themselves are minimal. A household using 10,000 kWh per year (some of the highest in the city) saving 600 kWh per year (more than any of the block groups saved) will only have a 6% reduction in their annual cost.

The estimated energy burden map shows that certain neighborhoods, such as Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester, have a higher estimated energy burden than others. These neighborhoods also tend to have lower median household incomes, which suggests that energy costs may be disproportionately burdensome for low-income households in these areas. Additionally, certain block groups within neighborhoods have higher estimated energy burdens than others, indicating that energy burden may be a localized issue within some neighborhoods. The map of areas with the worst energy burden highlights block groups with the highest estimated energy burden in the city. These areas tend to be in neighborhoods with lower median household incomes, such as Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester, explored further in Figure 9.

The bivariate choropleth map showing the relationship between estimated energy burden and high-income residents reveals a clear pattern: high-income areas tend to have lower estimated energy burdens than low-income areas. This highlights the potential unequal distribution of energy burden across different income groups within the city of Boston. Some of the wealthiest areas, like Roslindale, West Roxbury, Charlestown, the South End and Bay Village have low burdens and high incomes. Recall Figure 2, on concentration of energy-efficient (but expensive) heat pump technology. The areas of highest density of that tech are located in areas that are the wealthiest, and also some of the lowest burdens.

The bivariate choropleth map showing the relationship between estimated energy burden and limited English proficiency reveals that areas with a higher percentage of residents who are limited English proficient tend to have higher estimated energy burdens. This suggests that language barriers may make it difficult for households to access energy-saving programs and resources, leading to higher energy costs.

The bivariate choropleth map showing the relationship between estimated energy burden and the percentage of residents who are renters indicates that areas with a higher percentage of renters tend to have higher estimated energy burdens. Renters may be less likely to invest in energy-saving measures, such as insulation or weatherization since they do not own the property and may not see a direct benefit from these investments.

Lastly, the map of areas with both the worst energy burden, lowest electric and savings, and higher concentrations of multifamily houses with between 2 and 6 units, shows block groups that have both a high estimated energy burden and low average savings from utility energy efficiency programs. These areas may be particularly in need of targeted outreach and assistance to help households reduce their energy costs. They are largely concentrated in Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester, though there are a few elsewhere (Brighton and Charlestown, Hyde Park, JP). This information could be useful in designing policies meant to target low efficiency properties with high risk residents, and is the culmination of the report’s analytical efforts.

# Key Findings

- Housing types vary across neighborhoods, with downtown areas having more apartments and condos, while outer neighborhoods have more single-family homes.
- Heat pump technology, an indicator of energy efficiency, is concentrated in downtown and East Boston areas.
- Highest electricity consumption occurs in downtown areas and parts of the South End.
- Gas consumption is highest in Dorchester, Mattapan, Jamaica Plain, and parts of Brighton.
- Energy burden is highest in neighborhoods with lower median household incomes, such as Roxbury, Mattapan, and Dorchester.
- Areas with higher percentages of limited English proficient residents and renters tend to have higher energy burdens.

# Conclusions
The study highlights specific areas in Boston where increased energy efficiency programming would have the maximum benefit. It reveals that access to energy-efficient housing is not equitably distributed across the city, with low-income areas facing higher energy burdens and living in housing that often needs upgrades.
The findings emphasize the need for targeted policies and programs to address energy efficiency in low-income areas, considering factors such as language barriers and the unique needs of each community. This is crucial for Boston's transition to a low-carbon, sustainable energy future and for addressing energy equity issues.
